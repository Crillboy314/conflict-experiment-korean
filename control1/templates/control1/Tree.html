        You have been randomly assigned the role of <strong>First Person</strong>, while the other player is Second Person. During the activity
        you will see a figure like the one below. The figure will help you see the possible outcomes of the scenario based on your and the other
        participant's decisions. You and the other participant randomly matched with you can send messages to each other before making your decisions.
        These messages can only have the following form: <strong>“I choose A”</strong> or <strong>“I choose B,”</strong> and this applies to all
        participants.
    </p>

    <p>
        As First Person, you will be moving first and have two options, <strong>A</strong> or <strong>B</strong>. You will send a message in the
        form of <strong>"I choose A"</strong> or <strong>"I choose B"</strong> to the Second Person matched with you. After the Second Person
        receives your message, they must send you their message in the form <strong>"I choose A"</strong> or <strong>"I choose B"</strong>. This
        message exchange will only take place once. After receiving Second Person's message, you can change your decision and Second Person can also
        change theirs. Again, you will be making your decision before Second Person who will know your decision
        before making theirs, but you will not know Second Person decision. Second Person will also be told this.
    </p>

    <p>
        When you choose <strong>A</strong> in Figure 1, then the following outcomes are possible:
        <ol>
            <li>If Second Person chooses <strong>A</strong>, then both of you will receive <strong>10 points</strong> each.</li>
            <li>If Second Person chooses <strong>B</strong>, then you will receive <strong>70 points</strong> and Second Person will receive <strong>20 points</strong>.</li>
        </ol>
        On the other hand, when you choose <strong>B</strong>, then the follow outcomes are possible:
        <ol>
            <li>If Second Person chooses <strong>A</strong>, then you will receive <strong>20 points</strong> and Second Person will receive <strong>70 points</strong>.</li>
            <li>If Second Person chooses <strong>B</strong>, then you will both receive <strong>40 points</strong> each.</li>
        </ol>
