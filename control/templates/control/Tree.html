        you will see a figure like the one below. The figure will help you see the possible outcomes of the scenario based on your and the other
        participant's decisions. As First Person, you have two options, either <strong>A</strong> or <strong>B</strong>, located at the top of the figure. Once you make your 
        decision you cannot change your mind. Second Person will know your choice when they make their decision, and you will not know theirs.
